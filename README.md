# Mini Project in Rust
This is a mini project I wrote in Rust. The program takes user input for Student name and age, and adds valid student in the Student list. 

Add Student logic runs in infinite loop until user presses ‘q’ to exit, which then displays the list of users added in the course and program exits.

After cloning the repo, run
```cargo run```
